// Gist: Note, that CardTheme can also be reference in app screen as
//       CardTheme.of(context)
//       Per MD3 https://m3.material.io/components/cards/specs
//       there are now three types of cards:
//          Elevated
//          Filled
//          Outlined
//
//       Things that vary per different cards are:
//             elevation
//             surface color
//
//       Choosing to impl the 3 card types via widget expresssion at 
//       screen level as I know the 2nd-phase of MD3 support in card might 
//       be seperating into 3 card widget classes or 3 specialized 
//       card constructors.
